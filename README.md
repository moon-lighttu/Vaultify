## 🔹 Installation & Local Setup

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moon-lighttu/Vaultify
cd personal-finance-dashboard
```

2. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend dev server defaults to `http://localhost:5173`.

3. Backend

```bash
cd ../backend
python3.12 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Database

Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running. Create a database (example: `finance_db`) and add a `.env` in `backend/` with at least:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/finance_db
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

Run migrations (Alembic):

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

5. Run backend

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000` and API docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## 🔹 Production / Deployment Notes

- Build frontend for production: `npm run build` in `frontend/` and serve the static assets with your preferred static server (or integrate into a Docker image).
- Serve the backend with Uvicorn/Gunicorn behind a reverse proxy (NGINX). Configure environment variables and a managed Postgres instance for production.
- Consider using `docker` for a reproducible deployment: build separate services for frontend and backend and a managed Postgres service.
